###A simple website template for showing information and images.

Information is a mobile-friendly website template designed to have an intuitive feel and simple and smooth UX/UI. It is designed for organizations showcasing information about themselves or their activities.

It uses * **no javascript,** * improving page load times by reducing file size and CPU load, as well as giving me a challenge.

Inspired by <a href="http://codepen.io/vaielab/pen/yoKEF">Duck Hunt CSS,</a> a recreation of the classic game using only HTML and CSS.
