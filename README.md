###A simple website template for showing information and images.

Information is a mobile-friendly website template designed to have an intuitive feel and simple and smooth UX/UI. It is designed for organizations showcasing information about themselves or their activities.

Originally designed to use no javascript, this project was reverted to a previous commit and continued with the use of javascript after I discovered that CSS animations cannot be reset with pure css.

CSS modified using SASS.

Lorum Ipsum and placeholder images are used.
